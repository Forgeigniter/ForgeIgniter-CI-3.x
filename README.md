## Getting Started & Guides 
We'd like to think FI is intuitive, but for the bits you can't work out on your own, we made friendly [user guides](http://www.forgeigniter.com/support) , just for you.

## v1.x - Branch
Older version, prefered by some as it uses the old lite theme and all moduels.

## v2.x - Branch 
Inlcudes, all the default features but with the addition of a new base theme, flexi auth and new admin template.
