# ForgeIgniter v2.x - CI-3.x
Friendly open source CMS forged on Codeigniter 3

Please don't use this in production enviroments, although no security issues have been reported, the auth needs updating. I do plan on making a final version then moving to CI4.

## Installation
To get started just upload all the files from ForgeIgniter to your webserver and go to your [www.domain.net]  
the installer will handle the rest for you.

## Getting Started & Guides 
We'd like to think FI is intuitive, but for the bits you can't work out on your own, we made friendly [user guides](http://www.forgeigniter.com/support) , just for you.

## v1.x  
Older version, prefered by some as it uses the old lite theme and all moduels.
